Although the parentage is relatively unknown due to breeder secrecy, it has been measured at having a 26% average THC level and a CBD level of approximately 1%. The 12th Man OG high is said to be a heavy body high with a mild head buzz thats pretty relaxing in nature as a whole. As the high builds, you feel yourself become lost within your own mind, slightly dazed like you just took a heavy hit from a lineman, minus the pain. Just be careful  the effects become pretty sedative if you toke a little too much. These effects coupled with its highly medicinal CBD level make 12th Man OG ideal for treating conditions such as chronic pain, depression, chronic stress or anxiety, and nausea. This bud has a classic sweet OG taste with hints of fresh grass and earth. The aroma is of spicy herbs with a powerful hit of sweet earth as the nugs are broken apart. 12th Man OG buds have small and round super leafy light minty green nugs with rich amber hairs and a frosty coating of tiny white crystal trichomes.",1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0

This strain is mostly indica (40:60 sativa/indica ratio), so the high is primarily focused on the body. 707 Headband has Kush and Diesel origins; it's a crossbreed of Sour Diesel, OG Kush, and Master Kush. The body high is deeply relaxing, but it's balanced out by clear-headed cerebral effects that keep users awake and spur creative thinking. True to its ancestry, this strain has a strong, pungent skunk smell, with hints of pine. The high is very happy and relaxed, with strong euphoria. That makes 707 Headband ideal for treating anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, spinal cord injuries, and chronic pain. Negative effects include limited dry mouth, while dry eyes and dizziness are also possible. This strain is found mostly on the West Coast and in Colorado, though it's also popular in Canada and can be found in other locations in the United States. Also known simply as Headbands, its name comes from the 707 area code, which serves the San Francisco Bay Area, and the ""headband"" effect users feel in their foreheads.

This aroma begins to make itself felt right at the start of the vegetative period and as the plant develops, so does its scent, while your nostrils might appreciate its rich complexity, your neighbours might feel differently so odour control will probably be a consideration for most growers. The smell really begins to develop during the curing process at which point the citrus fruitiness becomes clearly apparent. Depending your your seeds, you may find other notes in there too, from metal to ammonia. In terms of taste, the predominant flavours are skunk spiciness (some people detect cinnamon in particular) and citrus, almost a Thai sweet and sour effect. The smoke is gentle on the throat and is unlikely to trigger coughing. If you want the benefits without the taste, then CBD Queen is a great strain to use in cooking or in cannabis topicals. https://www.marijuana-seeds.nl/blog/cbd-queen-strain-scope",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

Everything done at Puffin Farm, from strain selection, to their slow cold cure, to their packaging, is focused on maximizing flavor, quality, and end user experience. The terpenes which give different strains their taste and smell are well known to effect the high, so the belief that if it tastes good it feels good is at the core of Puffins' chi.  They grow in full sun in Eastern Washington in natural soil, enriched with compost, worm castings, biochar, kelp and humic acids to maximize the rich terpene content. They use a lot of beneficial insects, like lacewings and ladybugs, to control insects. When necessary, they use harmless natural products like neem oil and rosemary oil on the vegetative plants to enrich their immune systems before their flowering path (pesticide free!). All buds are dried, cured, &amp; kept in cold storage with as little air as possible and packaged &amp; shipped as it's ordered by us. ",1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0

Migraines, pain, and arthritis are mowed down by Trainwrecks high THC content, and many patients also use it for relief of anxiety, ADD/ADHD, and PTSD.

The high starts with an uplifted clear-headed effect that leaves you laser-sharp focused but blissfully happy and overwhelmingly lazy. Youll be completely relaxed in both mind and body with a building sense of introspection that can leave you spacey at times.

215,10215,"Dutch Treat --- Dutch Treat. An all-around great high, deserving of a place in any discriminating chronnoisseurs head stash. Not surprisingly, Dutch Treat is an Amsterdam staple, an indica-dominant hybrid with a 20:80 sativa/indica ratio. The strain's limited sativa genetics produce a near-instant head rush, followed by a numbing body high somewhere short of couch-lock. Dutch Treat has THC levels reaching 18-25%, so it's strong but not aggressively so. It smells like eucalyptus and has a sweet, earthy pine flavor. The head high is intensely euphoric and upbeat, while the body high is deeply relaxed. Dutch Treat works well on anxiety and pain, and it's also helpful with insomnia. This strain is recommended for ADHD, PTSD, migraines, and arthritis. Adverse effects include dry mouth and red eyes. Outside Holland, Dutch Treat is most popular in the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest United States.

This cut was a local favorite in a small community there and was kept alive for many seasons before we got it as a gift from a new medical patient from the region, back when we operated a medical dispensary in 2013. Jack Herer was of course the famous Cannabis activist who fought for decades for decriminalization (if you haven't read 'The Emperor Wears No Clothes written by Herer, do yourself a favor and find a copy!). We gratefully accepted the clone and fell in love with the sugary flavors and uplifting high.

It can also treat anxiety and mood disorders. The buds are densely packed and sticky, with a heavy coating of trichomes. The smell is skunky, while the grape flavor harks back to this strain's Purple ancestry. It's an open question how much of this strain is indica and how much is sativa. The same goes for the CBD and THC contents of Grand Poobah. The high is relaxing but energized, with a heavier focus on body effects. Likely side effects include dry mouth and red eyes, though others are possible. Though it would be easier to find on the legal market, and is probably more common on the West Coast, it isn't widely available anywhere.

The genetics of Hawaii 5-0 are widely debated  although it is generally agreed that it's a cross of the Hawaiian Skunk X Northern Lights #5, some cannabis connoisseurs believe that there may be a phenotype of Maui Wowie at play as well. This bud is ideal for day use, as it offers the user a potent cerebral head high with euphoria and an influx of energy that melts into a couch-locked body stone that still leaves you functional. In addition to these effects, users often feel a stimulated appetite that leaves them with the munchies about 1-2 hours after dosing. Hawaii 5-0 is ideal for treating patients suffering from conditions such as chronic pain and stress, insomnia, and appetite and eating disorders. The taste of Hawaii 5-0 is strong and hashy with a syrupy sweet aftertaste, and it has a tropical diesel smell with hints of sweet berry.

The plant itself is of medium height, with a small amount of leaves. The effects are more similar to a smooth relaxed type of buzz, with you feeling happy, upbeat and ready to be creative after smoking it. Due to its potency, it is very commonly used as a pain reliever in medicine, but is also used to treat insomnia, stress and nausea. The aroma of the plant itself is comparable to kush, and has a strongly spiced and citrusy smell mixed in as well. Its taste is like that of pine, but with a earthy and sweet combination thrown in.

Ushered in by a sweet herbal aroma, Jamaican Lion induces mild psychoactivity that carries through despite its low THC content. Sensory perception sharpens as bad moods dull in clear-headed sensations that can be described as simultaneously uplifting and calming. Few strains compare to Jamaican Lion as it eases pain, anxiety, and inflammation without intoxication or mental cloudiness. Its CBD content is highest around week 9 of flowering, but if youre looking for more of a 1:1 ratio of CBD and THC, Shadrock recommends harvesting at week 8 instead."" https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jamaican-lion",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0

For those hoping to fill their gardens with this resinous, skunky hybrid, growers recommend an indoor environment with either soil or hydroponic setups.

At a super-secret installation at the University of Mississippi, they bred many new super hybrids in the late 1960s. Allegedly, a single cutting of this plant was liberated by an unnamed technician and bred for the masses. Although the legends are probably not true, G13 delivers effects like no other.

The Citrus Sap high is incredibly unique in that it brings on both couch-lock and mental stimulation, ending in a full-bodied high that can kill any ache or pain with ease. Youll feel a euphoric rush of uplifted energy at first toke, infusing you with feelings of focus and mental clarity to start. This motivation will soon become slightly stoney, fading in and out of concentration as the high builds. A body buzz will suddenly take hold, creeping up on you before locking you down to wherever you happen to be sitting. As your body relaxes into a deep stone, your mind will still be active and energized, running through deep introspective thought. In combination with its super high 18-24% THC level, these heavy effects give Citrus Sap an edge in treating conditions such as chronic fatigue, depression, chronic pain, and headaches or migraines. Citrus Sap has a tangy and spicy citrus flavor and smell with a touch of earthy pungency on exhale. It has lumpy piecey bright neon green nugs with orange hairs and a coating of beautiful golden crystal trichomes.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

Green Crack has branched into two genetic lineages, the most common of which is its sativa line descended from Skunk #1. The 75% indica variety of Green Crack is said to have come from an Afghani strain, and is marked by a tighter bud structure. Because its name perpetuates a negative image of cannabis, some people have taken to calling this strain Cush (with a C) or Green Cush instead.

Mastodon Kush will thrive when cultivated in either a SCRoG or SoG environment, where the yield will go from slightly above average to heavy. These ladies like to be grown in soil, whether indoors or outdoors. Outdoors they will be ready for harvest by the end of September, while taking 8 or 9 weeks indoors.

This ground-breaking production process captures a rich profile of essential cannabinoids, terpenes and organic compounds normally left out in typical RSO. The additional extraction process yields components such as alkaloids, flavonoids and polysaccharides commonly found in cannabis juicing. A single gram of our juice concentrate is equivalent to 200 grams of fresh whole cannabis plant! Leaving the old-school syringe in the past, the FECO now comes in an easy to use discrete pocket pen that guarantees a 50mg serving size with a simple click! Note: This product has not been approved by the FDA to treat, cure or prevent any disease. The 10:1 CBD to THC ratio provides a minimal psychoactive effect, with each serving delivering a powerful dose of CBD. The small amount of THC synergizes to enhance the benefits of CBD.

Though its parents are decidedly sativa-dominant, Pennywise is an indica-heavy cross with a sativa/indica ratio of roughly 30:70. That makes for a mild but clear-headed physical high with a dose of euphoria. In addition to epilepsy, this strain is effective treatment for cancer symptoms, arthritis, PTSD, neurological disorders, and anxiety. The smell is pungent and woody while the flavor is sweet with notes of wood.",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
245,7735,"Pennywise by Trail Blazin' --- 10.0% THC 10.1% CBD Pennywise is a high-CBD indica cross between Harlequin and Jack the Ripper, a combination that lends this strain its killer clown name. Four phenotypes of this Stephen King-inspired strain exist, some of which have fingerlike buds while others appear more round. Notes of coffee and pepper lift from the purple-fringed flowers with undertones of lemon and bubblegum. Rich in the therapeutic compound CBD, Pennywise is especially effective in treating arthritis, PTSD, epilepsy, neurological disorders, and cancer symptoms. It contains a 1:1 ratio of CBD and THC, so the psychoactive effects are milder and more relaxing. Jack the Rippers cerebrally focused effects are detectable in Pennywises genes as euphoria and mental clarity take over with an invigorating buzz. Pennywise flowers in 60 to 67 days and is suitable for either indoor or outdoor gardens. - Leafly.com",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

This strain is thought to be a specific phenotype (same genetics, different end result) of Skunk #1 that was originally cultivated in the early 1990s by a UK collective group known as Exodus. (As a result, this strain is also known as Exodus Cheese.) UK Cheese became popular for its energetic, euphoric head effects combined with its impressive pain relief potential. It quickly spread beyond the borders of its British home. Most users experience alert, sativa effects that allow for mental relaxation without sedation, but it may hasten bedtime for some. Effects tend to be felt in the head first, generally around the eyes, then spread throughout the entire body, producing muscle relaxation and even some tingly numbness.

This heavy-hitting sativa gives the users an overwhelming body buzz and laziness, but without limiting functionality or causing couch-lock. The effects come on quick and are long lasting, making this bud ideal for day use. This strain is ideal for treating patients with mood disorders, including mood swings, and manic depression due to its relaxing nature. Purple Pineberry has a strong fruity smell and a lemony pine taste that sweetens as you exhale. With a 15-18% average THC level and a sweet and fruity taste, this strain is a great choice for newer users and seasoned users alike who are looking a relaxing high that doesn't stick them to the couch for the rest of the day. But beware  if you smoke too much at once, you run the risk of a pretty severe headache and pain in the temples. This bud has dank, dense nugs that are blanketed in snowy white trichomes and a light sticky resin, making it look just as good as it tastes.

Combining a Haze hybrid with a Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk cross, Sensi Seeds created Jack Herer hoping to capture both the cerebral elevation associated with sativas and the heavy resin production of indicas. Its rich genetic background gives rise to several different variations of Jack Herer, each phenotype bearing its own unique features and effects. However, consumers typically describe this 55% sativa hybrid as blissful, clear-headed, and creative. Jack Herer was created in the Netherlands in the mid-1990s, where it was later distributed by Dutch pharmacies as a recognized medical-grade strain. Since then, the spicy, pine-scented sativa has taken home numerous awards for its quality and potency. Many breeders have attempted to cultivate this staple strain themselves in sunny or Mediterranean climates, and indoor growers should wait 50 to 70 days for Jack Herer to flower - @Leafly.com",1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0

245,9503,"Shark Attack by Sasquatch Greenhouses --- 18.0% THC 0.2% CBD A 70/30 indica-dominant hybrid from Dinafem Seeds, Shark Attack is a cross of Super Skunk and White Widow. Though it produces relatively modest levels of THC (12-16%) and significant amounts of CBD, the high is powerfully relaxing and long lasting, and can offer relief from aches and pain. Shark Attack produces a very strong odor of earthy hash with floral and lemon undertones, and tastes much like it smells. Because it is compact, easy to grow, and high yielding, as well as being suitable for indoor, outdoor, or greenhouse cultivation, Shark Attack is fast becoming one of the more popular hybrids available in feminized seed form. -Leafly",1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0

Instead, you can expect an invigorating cerebral high that open up doors of creativity. Although sour diesel consists of some indicia, it's not the best strain for sleeping because of the stimulating and lively head high that it delivers. Due to the effervescent contained within this strain, many people choose to smoke sour diesel at the beginning of their day for a head start. The potency of this strain is just enough to give you a great high and become your daily toke. The word ""diesel"" in sour diesel didn't come out of absolutely nowhere.

Eventually bringing forth average sized yields with tightly packed clusters of trichome encrusted nuggets that ripen to completion by the beginning of October when cultivated outdoors. She will most likely need a bit of training to bush her out a bit more and control the stretch, as well as helping to support her branches because her excessive flower weight will bend or even break her branches if not tied or staked up correctly.

Though they don't share many genes, the two Tangerines share a strong, sweet flavor reminiscent of tangerines and other citrus fruits. Tangie is sativa-heavy, and though the exact ratio of sativa to indica is unclear, it's probably at least 70:30. That means an uplifting cerebral high with enhanced creativity and euphoria, plus a focused boost of happiness. It's good for treating several disorders, though specifics are hard to come by: nausea, anxiety, lack of appetite, and depression. The only widely reported problems are bloodshot eyes and dry mouth, so this may be a good choice for patients sensitive to side effects.
