The Difference?

During the post processing phase of the cannabis extraction process, there are a number of different things that affect the color, texture, and overall user friendliness of a hydrocarbon wax. Too much light exposure before intake for example, or the temperature of a transportation vehicle, and so on. In these cases, while the outcome is still a top shelf experience, with a high terpene product - the product may appear darker than a Bodhi High Product. These Premium extracts are the backbone of our Honey tree extracts line.

Since finding its way to U.S. shores, the lineage of this nearly pure indica strain becomes more foggy. While some insist Bubba Kush was first bred on the West Coast from OG Kush and landrace genetics, its origins are poorly documented and uncertain. Green House Seeds also cultivates a unique rendition of Bubba Kush using Bubble Gum and Kush. 

Despite its wide proliferation, Bubba Kush exhibits a distinctive, bulky bud structure with hues that range from forest green to pale purple. Its effects may begin focused in the head, but it isnt long before the buzz reaches the rest of the body. Some might consider couchlock an inevitable consequence of Bubba Kush, making this powerhouse indica a perfect go-to strain for evening relaxation, restful sleep, or a lazy weekend at home.

The smell is an amazing mix of intensive bubblegum with small touches of Chemdawg, absolutely delicious. Bubblegum which was originated in Indiana during 1970s, is an almost 50/50 split across indica and sativa dominance. The bubblegum hybrid strain was created by crossing Indiana Bubblegum with an unidentified indica cannabis strain. This strain was then taken to Amsterdam in order to clone and hybridize. It took several years to finally come up with a stable bubblegum strain with the typical sweet odor and euphoric high. The strain got its name for its smell which is just like the pink bubble gum. This medical marijuana strain was able to acquire a quick reputation for its sweetness. It has a mild taste with bubble gum flavor both during inhale and exhale. This strain is the winner of several accolades and has been placed frequently in the 'High Times Cannabis Cup'. The plant appears light green colored with several bright orange colored hairs. The buds will look airy with lots of crystals that appear snowy. This strain will give the classic effects of old-school indica that will last up to two hours. Patients with stress, anxiety and tension are found to have good results upon using this strain. Bubblegum also has the mood-elevating property.  Chemdawg  this strain has developed quite the name for itself over the years. Between its mysterious origin, ambiguous genetics, and the plethora of successful crosses the strain has produced, Chemdawg has practically secured itself a permanent place in the cannabis hall of fame. The original source of powerhouse strains like Sour Diesel and OG Kush, Chemdawg is known for its distinct, diesel-like aroma. Pungent and sharp, youll be able to smell this hybrid from a mile away.

Chemdawg 91 is thought to be an offshoot of the original Chemdawg strain, and the numerical addition of 91 is believed to reference the year the strain first came into existence.

Some growers believe Chemdawg 91 to be a cross between Chemdawg and Skunk, which may explain its particularly pungent aroma. In true family spirit, this hybrid has a very strong diesel smell with a piney-lemon aftertaste.

The strain's limited sativa genetics produce a near-instant head rush, followed by a numbing body high somewhere short of couch-lock. Dutch Treat has THC levels reaching 18-25%, so it's strong but not aggressively so. It smells like eucalyptus and has a sweet, earthy pine flavor. The head high is intensely euphoric and upbeat, while the body high is deeply relaxed. Dutch Treat works well on anxiety and pain, and it's also helpful with insomnia. This strain is recommended for ADHD, PTSD, migraines, and arthritis. Adverse effects include dry mouth and red eyes. Outside Holland, Dutch Treat is most popular in the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest United States. It's a descendant of Northern Lights, a famed indica; skunk, a potent hybrid; and Haze, one of the most popular sativas of all time. That mixed but esteemed heritage makes Dutch Treat a fun, effective treatment for both mental and physical suffering. As a heavy indica, this strain can be a bit hard to find, but it's common enough in places where marijuana is legal.

At a super-secret installation at the University of Mississippi, they bred many new super hybrids in the late 1960s. Allegedly, a single cutting of this plant was liberated by an unnamed technician and bred for the masses.  Although the legends are probably not true, G13 delivers effects like no other.

4596,"Green Crack by Captain Easy's Buds --- 19.6% THC 0.1% CBD A perennial favorite, Green Crack is a sativa-dominant hybrid that was bred by inbreeding Skunk #1. Green Crack is usually sativa-dominant, but there's also a less popular indica-heavy version of the strain. Green Crack got its name from Snoop Dogg, though it's also known as Green Cush or simply Cush among smokers who prefer not to reference cocaine. This highly addictive strain is massively potent, with top THC levels reaching 24%. It has a sativa/indica ratio of 65:35. The high is decidedly cerebral, with a big mood boost and a jolt of energy. This strain spurs creativity and helps patients get things done. It's most effective in treating anxiety and depression, along with ADHD, PTSD, and migraines. Green Crack has a sweet flavor with tropical and citrus notes. The buds are dense and tight. Dry mouth occurs frequently, while dry eyes, dizziness, and paranoia, happen less often. It's most common in the Pacific Northwester, California, Arizona, and Colorado. But it can be found almost anywhere else with relative ease. It's one of the most popular strains on the black market for this reason.

It's the offspring of the ever-popular Blue Dream, a sativa-dominant hybrid, and Northern Lights #5, an indica-dominant descendant of the famed Northern Lights. THC levels top 20% in some tests, making this a particularly potent choice. CBD levels, on the other hand, are probably quite low, making this a less-than ideal choice for patients with seizures or other problems that respond to CBD. Paradoxically, given the head-focused high, Blue Boy works best as medication for physical ailments, including chronic pain and lack of appetite. It's also an effective medication for insomnia, anxiety, and depression, delivering a state of worry-free relaxation. The aroma is pungent and earthy while the flavor of this strain is very sweet. Cottonmouth is a relatively common complaint from patients who have used Blue Boy, as is bloodshot eyes; paranoia is also reported, but less likely. This strain is found almost exclusively on the medical and recreational markets of the Pacific Northwest. ",1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
1363,"Green Freedom - Chocolate Kush --- Chocolate Kush is a blend of Chocolope, a potent pure sativa, and Kosher Kush, an indica-dominant hybrid.

This strain isn't especially powerful, with THC levels hovering around 14%, but it's potent enough to be a useful medical choice for many patients. CBD levels are much lower, about 1%, but that's still much more than most marijuana strains, so Chocolate Kush may be a helpful source of treatment for epilepsy and other disorders that can be treated with CBD. Otherwise, the THC side of this strain makes it a good option for anxiety, pain, nausea, sleeplessness, tumors, and lack of appetite. The mostly physical effects are lazy and sleepy, with a shot of euphoria, happiness, mental relief, and creativity. Negative effects can include dry mouth and dry eyes, while dizziness and paranoia are also possible. This strain has a strong chocolate aroma with hints of vanilla and a sweet, earthy Skunk flavor.

As soon as you smoke the strain, you will feel your eyes getting heavy. A hit or two is more than enough to before you start feeling lazy. In time you may even experience symptoms of couch-lock. But then again, you will feel happy and euphoric which is why it is often recommended to patients suffering from stress and anxiety.

Jack Herer is a sativa-dominant cannabis strain that has gained as much renown as its namesake, the marijuana activist and author of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. Combining a Haze hybrid with a Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk cross, Sensi Seeds created Jack Herer hoping to capture both the cerebral elevation associated with sativas and the heavy resin production of indicas. Its rich genetic background gives rise to several different variations of Jack Herer, each phenotype bearing its own unique features and effects. However, consumers typically describe this 55% sativa hybrid as blissful, clear-headed, and creative.

Jack Herer was created in the Netherlands in the mid-1990s where it was later distributed by Dutch pharmacies as a recognized medical-grade strain. Since then, the spicy, pine-scented sativa has taken home numerous awards for its quality and potency. Many breeders have attempted to cultivate this staple strain themselves in sunny or Mediterranean climates, and indoor growers should wait 50 to 70 days for Jack Herer to flower.

It has a pungent but sweet earthy flavor and a light citrus smell that can be hard to detect. The dominant feeling while high is one of total relaxation, along with euphoria and sleepiness, all products of the strain's genetic heritage. This makes it a good treatment for sleeplessness.

15003,"NW Nectar - Weedle Sugar Wax 1g --- 75.6% THC 0.0% CBD Weedle is an extremely rare sativa dominant hybrid strain created through a cross of the infamous Jack Herer X Trainwreck. Not to be confused with the Pokmon or its sister strain, Jack Wreck, Weedle is an experience all of its own that offers energetic and dreamy effects that can be psychedelic and overpowering at times, especially if you are a novice user. The Weedle high hits you as soon as you exhale with a full on rush to the head of cerebral effects, infusing you with energy and launching your mind into deep imaginative introspection. As your mind soars, your body will start to feel slightly buzzy and relaxed which may cause some users to become sleepy despite their increase in energy. Because of these effects and its high 20-23% average THC level, Weedle is the perfect choice for treating conditions such as chronic stress, appetite loss, depression, chronic fatigue, and insomnia. Weedle has a sweet lemony kush flavor thats reminiscent of its Jack Herer parent and an aroma to match that has a slightly pungent undertone. Weedle buds have small dense dark forest green nugs with sparse amber hairs and a frosty dusting of tiny amber tinted crystal trichomes. - Allbud",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

OG Kush makes up the genetic backbone of West Coast cannabis varieties, but in spite of its ubiquity, its genetic origins remain a mystery. Popular myth maintains that Chemdawg and Hindu Kush parented OG Kush, passing on the distinct kush bud structure we see in many strains today. However, we cant be sure because OG Kush first came from bag seed in the early 90s. The earliest propagators (now known as Imperial Genetics) are said to have brought the seeds out of Florida to Colorado and southern California, where it now flourishes. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush, some of which include Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Alpha OG.

Underdog OG, also known as Underdawg OG, is a slightly indica dominant hybrid (60% indica/40% sativa) strain created through a cross of the classic Sour Diesel X OG Kush strains. A sister to the classic Chemdawg family, this bud brings a mellow calming high and painkilling effects that last for hours on end. The Underdog OG high starts with a slight euphoric lift that is pretty mellow and wont cause you any sort of anxiety. This effect is long-lasting and can become sedative at times, lulling you into a sleepy state that often ends in a nice long nap. Because of these effects and its high 25% average THC level, Underdog OG is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as chronic pain, insomnia, chronic stress or anxiety, and muscle spasms. This bud has super dense light minty green grape-shaped nugs with sparse bright orange hairs and a coating of thick frosty bright white crystal trichomes. Underdog OG has a sweet herbal tea flavor with a hint of kush. The aroma is of herbal sweet earth with a super dank pungency that can fill a room with its potent stench.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

Popular myth maintains that Chemdawg and Hindu Kush parented OG Kush, passing on the distinct kush bud structure we see in many strains today. However, we cant be sure because OG Kush first came from bag seed in the early 90s. The earliest propagators (now known as Imperial Genetics) are said to have brought the seeds out of Florida to Colorado and southern California, where it now flourishes. There are many different phenotypes of OG Kush, some of which include Tahoe OG, SFV OG, and Alpha OG. 

OG Kush is cherished for its ability to crush stress under the weight of its heavy euphoria. It carries an earthy pine and sour lemon scent with woody undertones, an aroma that has become the signature of OG Kush varieties and descendants.

As the plant migrated to North America the growers kept the Cough surname, interchanging the region or city it represented. Starting with Colorado Cough, the genetics spread northwest to include Seattle Cough as well as Canadian Cough.

Seattle Cough (no relation to Strawberry Cough) carries a pungent mix of pine and citrus flavors. The aroma of fresh grapefruit serves as a precursor to the uplifting sativa effects, sparking creativity and dreamy euphoria.
